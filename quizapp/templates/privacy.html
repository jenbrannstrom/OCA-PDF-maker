            <ol>
                <li>We rely on third parties, for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To provide you our Website (such as a hosting provider); or</li>
                        <li>To target our promotional information (such as a marketing company); or</li>
                        <li>To process your order (such as a transport company to deliver you the materials); or</li>
                        <li>To process your payment (such as a payment service provider or a credit checking agency).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These third parties are only allowed to process your personal data on our behalf and upon our explicit written instruction. We also warrant that all those third parties are selected with due care and are committed to observing the safety and integrity of your personal data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>We may share your personal data with other national, regional or local organizations of the Church of Scientology, such as local Churches, Missions and social betterment and humanitarian programs. For example, we may share your contact details with a Church in your area if you have expressed an interest in joining a Scientology organization so that they can contact you. However, we will ensure that all Scientology organizations will take due care that all processing of your personal data is in line with what is set out in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>We may share your personal data for the purposes mentioned in Article 3 with the International Association of Scientologists Administrations (<a href="https://www.iasmembership.org/about/privacy-notice.html">IASA</a>) and the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises (<a href="http://www.wise.org/en_US/feature/legal/privacy.html">WISE</a>). If you require more information about the personal data IASA and WISE process, you are kindly requested to consult their respective privacy policies.</li>
                <li>We may be legally obliged to share your personal data with competent law enforcement agents or representatives, judicial authorities, governmental agencies or bodies, including competent data protection authorities, to comply with a legal obligation as set out in Article 3 above.</li>
                <li>We do not send your personal data in an identifiable manner to any other third party than the ones mentioned in Articles 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 without your explicit consent to do so. However, we may send anonymized data to other organizations that may use those data for improving materials and services as well as to tailor the marketing, displaying and selling of those materials and services.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>WHERE DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>We process your personal data both within and outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the USA. In order to process your personal data for the purposes outlined in Article 3 above, we may also transfer your personal data to third parties who process on our behalf outside the EEA. Each entity outside the EEA that processes your personal data will be bound to observe adequate safeguards with regard to the processing of your personal data. For CSI, such safeguards result from the fact that we are directly bound by compliance with EU legislation in the context of personal data protection. For third parties, such safeguards may be the consequence of: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The recipient country having legislation in place which may be considered equivalent to the protection offered within the EEA; or</li>
                        <li>A contractual arrangement between us and that entity; or</li>
                        <li>An approved certification mechanism, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield decision adopted by the European Commission on 12 July 2016.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We may transfer anonymized and/or aggregated data to organizations outside the EEA. Should such transfer take place, we will ensure that there are safeguards in place to ensure the safety and integrity of your data and all rights with respect to your personal data you might enjoy under applicable mandatory law.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

                <li>You have <u>the right to rectification</u>, <em>e.</em> to ask that any personal data pertaining to you that are inaccurate, are corrected free of charge.

                <li>You have <u>the right to withdraw your earlier given consent</u> for processing of your personal data.</li>

However, you need to keep in mind that a request for deletion will be evaluated by us against:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our and a third parties&rsquo; interests which may override your interests; or</li>
                        <li>Legal or regulatory obligations or administrative or judicial orders which may contradict such deletion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You have <u>the right to restriction</u> instead of deletion, <em>e. </em>to request that we limit the processing of your personal data if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are verifying the accuracy of your personal data; or</li>
                        <li>The processing is unlawful and you oppose the deletion of your personal data; or</li>
                        <li>You require your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, while we do no longer need your personal data for the purposes listed under Article 3 above; or</li>
                        <li>We are verifying whether our legitimate interests override your interests if you exercise your right to object in accordance with Article 7.6.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You have <u>the right to object</u> to the processing of personal data if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The processing is based on our legitimate interest under Article 3 above; and</li>
                        <li>You are able to prove that there are serious and justified reasons connected with your particular situation that warrant such objection; and</li>
                        <li>Our legitimate interests do not override your interests.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, if the intended processing qualifies as direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing free of charge and without justification.</p>
                </li>
                <li>You have <u>the right to data portability</u>, <em>e.</em> to receive from us in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format all personal data you have provided to us if the processing is based on your consent or a contract with you under Article 3 above.</li>
                <li>If you wish to <u>submit a request</u> to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, you can contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:dpo@scientology.net">dpo@scientology.net</a>.
